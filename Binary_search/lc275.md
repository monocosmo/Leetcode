# 275. H-Index II
### Medium

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in ascending order, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1:**
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**思路：**

这道题无法直接套用九章的二分法公式（即 l + 1 < r，最后答案是 l 或者 r)。因为H-Index可能是array里的值也可能不是。这就导致二分法的两行头疼的代码（如果希望一次写对不用debug的话）： l <= r 或 l < r； l = mid 或 l = mid + 1。
或许可以这样背一下：
1. 极端情况 len(array) = 1, 如果这种情况不希望跳过循环，那只能是 l <= r。
2. 既然条件是 l <= r，为了避免死循环，肯定不能 l = mid。
在二分的过程中持续update return value是一种经典设计：h_index = max(h_index, better_papers)，这样可以避免过度思考结束循环后的情况：即只要保证array肯定会过循环且肯定会循环完所有的值，那么最佳return value肯定就被记录下来了。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        h_index = 0

        while l <= r:
            mid = (r - l) // 2 + l
            better_papers = n - mid
            if citations[mid] == better_papers:
                return better_papers
            elif citations[mid] > better_papers:
                h_index = max(h_index, better_papers)
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return h_index
```
