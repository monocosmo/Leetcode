# 164. Maximum Gap
### Medium

Given an integer array nums, return the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form. If the array contains less than two elements, return 0.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.
```

**思路：**

1. n = len(nums), min = min(nums), max = max(nums), 那么两个相邻数字的最大差肯定大于等于 (max - min) / (n - 1)
2. 那么可以考虑将数字分成 n 个桶，每个桶的大小为 ceiling((max - min) / (n - 1)), 这样两个相邻数字的最大差就肯定会在两桶之间而不是一桶之内了。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # theory:
        # n = len(nums), min = min(nums), max = max(nums)
        # then maximum difference between two successive elevements is equal or greater than (max - min) / (n - 1)

        # divide nums into n buckets, start with bucket #0
        # bucket_size = ceiling((max - min) / (n - 1))
        # for bucket #i, it contains numbers in the range of [min + i * bucket_size, min + (i + 1) * bucket_size)

        # according to the theory, maximum difference can only happen between min of current bucket vs. max of previous bucket
        n = len(nums)
        max_num = max(nums)
        min_num = min(nums)
        # skip corner cases
        if n < 2 or max_num == min_num:
            return 0
        bucket_size = math.ceil((max_num - min_num) / (n - 1))
        # record min and max of each bucket
        min_of_each_bucket = [float('inf')] * n
        max_of_each_bucket = [-float('inf')] * n
        for num in nums:
            idx = (num - min_num) // bucket_size
            min_of_each_bucket[idx] = min(min_of_each_bucket[idx], num) 
            max_of_each_bucket[idx] = max(max_of_each_bucket[idx], num)
        # find out maximum difference between min of current bucket vs. max of previous bucket
        # Note: need to skip all empty buckets, and bucket #0 always has a value
        max_difference = bucket_size
        pre_max = max_of_each_bucket[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min_of_each_bucket[i] == float('inf'):
                continue
            max_difference = max(max_difference, min_of_each_bucket[i] - pre_max)
            pre_max = max_of_each_bucket[i]
        return max_difference
