# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group
### Hard

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Note:**
1. Only constant extra memory is allowed.
2. You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

**Example:**
```
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
```

**思路：**

1. 找到第k+1个node。
2. 如果找到了，前k个node反转，后面的部分递归。
3. 如果没找到（递归出口），说明linked list（或者递归的剩余部分）不足k个，直接返回。

反转链表的常规操作背一下。

**Code:**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        # find the k+1 node
        cur = head
        count = 0
        while cur and count < k:
            cur = cur.next
            count +=1
        
        # divide the linked list into two parts, reverse the first k nodes
        # recurse on the next part
        
        # if there is a valid Part 1 (with k nodes)
        if count == k:
            # recurse on the Part 2
            cur = self.reverseKGroup(cur, k)
            # reverse the Part 1
            while count > 0:
                tmp = head.next
                head.next = cur
                # similar like reverse linked list problem
                # move head one step ahead
                # mark the orignal head as cur
                cur = head # READ AS: RENAME head AS cur
                head = tmp
                count -=1
            # Note: cur represents the newest head, so we rename it as head
            head = cur
        return head
```
