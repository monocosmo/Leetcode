# 1192. Critical Connections in a Network
### Hard

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

**Example :**

```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
```
