# 133. Friend Circles
### Medium

There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
```

**思路：**

题目给的是matrix，实际上是图的题。把题目翻译成图的语境思路就清晰了：
1. 每个学生是一个node
2. 如果M[u][v]就说明学生u和v之间有一条edge
因此这道题可以转化为图的遍历。全联通的部分是可以通过dfs或者bfs遍历的，无法联通的部分需要重新选一个起始点尝试遍历。转跳的次数就是要求的答案。

注意，是遍历图中的node，不是在matrix里遍历，因此是从 0 到 N-1。 matrix只是一个记录edge的方阵。

**Code:**
```python
from collections import deque
class Solution(object):
    def findCircleNum(self, M):
        """
        :type M: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not M:
            return 0
        
        # Node: student
        # Edge: (u, v) if M[u][v] = 1
        # iterate each node, and dfs/bfs its connected nodes, mark them as visited, count++
        
        n = len(M)
        visited = {i: False for i in range(n)}
        count = 0
##############    BFS    ################
        def bfs(init_node):
            q = deque([init_node])
            while q:
                u = q.popleft()
                visited[u] = True
                for v in range(n):
                    if M[u][v] and not visited[v]:
                        q.append(v)

##############    DFS    ################        
#         def dfs(u):
#             visited[u] = True
#             for v in range(n):
#                 if M[u][v] and not visited[v]:
#                     visited[v] = True
#                     dfs(v)
        
        for u in range(n):
            if not visited[u]:
                count +=1 # M[i][i] = 1 for all students
                # dfs(u)
                bfs(u)
        
        return count
```
