# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
### Easy

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

**思路：**

因为不允许额外空间，所以唯一能利用的存储空间就是array本身。array其实有两个属性：index和value，不要忽视了index也是可以用来记录的。 这道题提示了array长度为n，说明index的取值范围是[0,n-1]，同时value在[1,n]之间，说明value和index的取值范围正好契合。那么自然想到用index储存value信息。遍历数组，用index=num-1的那一个位置记录出现过的num（标记为负数）。最后扫描数组，返回依然是正数的数位。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # utilize the spec of array: index and value
        # the hint is len of array is n and nums are 1~n
        # so we can use index to record some info
        
        # use index = num - 1 to mark the num at index as negative
        # screen again to output the still positive position, which means they were not visited
        
        for num in nums:
            index = abs(num) - 1 # Don't forget this abs since the num might be changed by others
            nums[index] = -abs(nums[index])
        
        return [i + 1 for i, n in enumerate(nums) if n > 0]
```
