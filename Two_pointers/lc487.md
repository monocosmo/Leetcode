# 487. Max Consecutive Ones II
### Medium

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array if you can flip at most one 0.

**Example 1:**

`
Input: [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 4
Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the the maximum number of consecutive 1s.
    After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
`

**Note:**
* The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
* The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000.
