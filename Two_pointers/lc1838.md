# 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element
### Medium

The frequency of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. In one operation, you can choose an index of nums and increment the element at that index by 1.

Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.

**Example:**

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].
4 has a frequency of 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
```

**思路：**
双指针sliding window的经典思路：
1. 两个指针确定一段区域（在此题中就是需要increment成为相同数字的区域）
2. 判断此区域是否符合要求（过大或者过小），在此题中就是 incr > k。注意，双指针都需要带上 l <= r，别忘了这个条件
3. 区域过大就 l 向右移动，区域过小就 r 向右移动
    incr += (nums[r] - nums[r-1]) * (r - l)
    while l <= r and incr > k:
        incr -= (nums[r] - nums[l])
        l += 1

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        # sliding window:
        # every iteration, move r one step and add the nums[0] to nums[r-1] to nums[r]
        # if the incr ops > k, move l one step

        max_freq = 1
        incr = 0
        l = 0
        for r in range(1, len(nums)):
            incr += (nums[r] - nums[r-1]) * (r - l)
            while l <= r and incr > k:
                incr -= (nums[r] - nums[l])
                l += 1
            max_freq = max(max_freq, r - l + 1)
        return max_freq
