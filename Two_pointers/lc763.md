# 763. Partition Labels
### Medium

A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

**思路：**

首先记录每个字母最后出现的位置。

然后用两个指针标识区间的办法，左指针一个个的移动，右指针更新到左指针滑过的字母中最远的最后位置。如果左右指针碰面了，说明左指针滑过的区间内每个字母都满足要求了。这个时候就可以分段了。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def partitionLabels(self, S):
        """
        :type S: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # first loop: record last seen index of each char
        lastSeen = {}
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            lastSeen[c] = i
        
        # second loop:
        # pointer i iterates one by one
        # pointer maxLastSeen jump to max(maxLastSeen, lastSeen[c])
        # once i == maxLastSeen, it means all the chars in this part can be covered by maxLastSeen
        # so split part here and reset count
        res = []
        maxLastSeen = 0
        count = 0
        
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            count +=1
            maxLastSeen = max(maxLastSeen, lastSeen[c])
            if i == maxLastSeen:
                res.append(count)
                count = 0
        
        return res
```
