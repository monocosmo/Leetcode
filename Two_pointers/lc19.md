# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
### Medium

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:**
Given n will always be valid.

**思路：**

这也是快慢双指针的一个经典案例。快指针先走n-1步，然后两个指针一起走，直到快指针到尾，这时候慢指针就在从尾数第n个node。直接让慢比快晚走n步处理不了删除头节点的edge case。

注意：删除慢指针的时候需要慢指针的pre node，所以比较方便的是设置三个指针，pre，慢，快，三个一起动。

**Code:**
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        pre = ListNode(-1)
        pre.next = head
        p = head # slower
        q = head # quicker
        
        # q move first NOTE: n is always valid
        for i in range(n-1): # e.g. n = 3, q move two steps first
            q = q. next
        
        # p, q move together until q reaches the end
        while q.next:
            p = p.next
            q = q.next
            pre = pre.next
        
        # delete p
        pre.next = p.next
        
        # two edge cases: deleting the head
        if p == head and q == head:
            # delete head and there was one node in the linked list
            return None
        elif p == head and q != head:
            # delete head and there were more than one node in the linked list
            return p.next
        else:
            return head
