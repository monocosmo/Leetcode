# 223. Rectangle Area
### Medium

Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

**Example:**

```

Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
Output: 45
```

**思路：**
这道题可以稍微记一下如何通过坐标判断两个长方形是否overlap：
    common_x1 = max(ax1, bx1)
    common_x2 = min(ax2, bx2)
    common_y1 = max(ay1, by1)
    common_y2 = min(ay2, by2)
    dx = common_x2 - common_x1
    dy = common_y2 - common_y1
    if dx > 0 and dy > 0: # overlap

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def computeArea(self, ax1: int, ay1: int, ax2: int, ay2: int, bx1: int, by1: int, bx2: int, by2: int) -> int:
        # formula to calculate rectangle area using two diagnose points
        def area(x1, y1, x2, y2):
            return (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)
        
        # when a, b overlap or one is inside another:
        # area_a + area_b - area_common
        # when a, b not overlap:
        # area_a + area_b, in another word, area_common = 0

        common_x1 = max(ax1, bx1)
        common_x2 = min(ax2, bx2)
        common_y1 = max(ay1, by1)
        common_y2 = min(ay2, by2)
        
        dx = common_x2 - common_x1
        dy = common_y2 - common_y1

        if dx > 0 and dy > 0:
            common_area = dx * dy
        else:
            common_area = 0
        
        return area(ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2) + area(bx1, by1, bx2, by2) - common_area
```
