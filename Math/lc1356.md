# 1356. Sort Integers by the Number of 1 Bits
### Easy

You are given an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the array after sorting it.

**Example:**

```
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
```

**思路：**
这道题非常straight forward。主要记一下两点：
1. bin(x) 函数可以转化int成二进制的string
2.1. Python自定义comparator的语法：arr.sort(key = cmp_to_key(comparator))
2.2. 如果要升序排列，comparator函数 return 为 x1 - x2, 或者 -1

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def sortByBits(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:       
        def comparator(x1, x2):
            bits_x1 = bin(x1).count("1")
            bits_x2 = bin(x2).count("1")

            if bits_x1 == bits_x2:
                return x1 - x2
            
            return bits_x1 - bits_x2
        
        arr.sort(key = cmp_to_key(comparator))
        return arr
```
