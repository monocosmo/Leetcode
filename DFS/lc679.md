# 679. 24 Game
### Hard

You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators ['+', '-', '*', '/'] and the parentheses '(' and ')' to get the value 24
You are restricted with the following rules:
1. The division operator '/' represents real division, not integer division.
For example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.
2. Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use '-' as a unary operator.
For example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression "-1 - 1 - 1 - 1" is not allowed.
3. You cannot concatenate numbers together
For example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression "12 + 12" is not valid.

Return true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.

**Example 1:**
Input: cards = [4,1,8,7]
Output: true
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24

**思路：**
这道题思路其实比较直接，主要就是避免bug。例如，选出任意两个数计算之后，下一轮的dfs对象要加入临时计算结果且去掉已经用过的两个数。
```python
next_round = [op_res]
for k in range(len(cards)):
    if k != i and k != j:
        next_round.append(cards[k])
```

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def judgePoint24(self, cards: List[int]) -> bool:
        def ops(a, b):
            ops = [
                a + b,
                a - b,
                b - a,
                a * b
            ]
            if a != 0:
                ops.append(b / a)
            if b != 0:
                ops.append(a / b)
            return ops
        
        def dfs(cards):
            # dfs reaches the end of the branch, check result
            if len(cards) == 1:
                return abs(cards[0] - 24) < 0.01
            # pick two card to try all possible operations
            for i in range(len(cards)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(cards)):
                    for op_res in ops(cards[i], cards[j]):
                        next_round = [op_res]
                        for k in range(len(cards)):
                            if k != i and k != j:
                                next_round.append(cards[k])
                        if dfs(next_round):
                            # early termination
                            return True
            # return False
        
        return dfs(cards) 
```
