# 130. Surronded Regions
### Medium

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
```

**思路：**

首先理解题目：题目实际上是要求能够在遍历所有格子的时候区分两种 "O" -- 边沿上的 "O" 以及能从边沿 "O" 延伸访问到的 "O"; 完全处于中间隔离状态的 "O"。
数岛类题目有一个经典解法是一边遍历一边做标记。 这题也是利用这种思路：第一次遍历（DFS）的时候从边沿 "O" 出发，把边沿和边沿延伸 "O" 标记出来(改成别的字母或者记录坐标)。第二次遍历全局，把非边沿 "O" 改成 "X", 边沿和边沿延伸 "O" 改回 "O"。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def solve(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        # scan four edges of the board
        # once meet any 'O', dfs get all connected 'O's
        # these 'O's will not be captured, so mark them as 'E' first
        # scan the whole board, transfer all the remained 'O's to 'X' and transfer all 'E's back to 'O's
        r = len(board)
        c = len(board[0])

        def mark_edge_os(x, y):
            if x < 0 or x >= r or y < 0 or y >= c or board[x][y] != 'O':
                return
            board[x][y] = 'E'
            mark_edge_os(x + 1, y)
            mark_edge_os(x - 1, y)
            mark_edge_os(x, y + 1)
            mark_edge_os(x, y - 1)
        
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if i == 0 or i == r - 1 or j == 0 or j == c - 1:
                    if board[i][j] == 'O':
                        mark_edge_os(i, j)
        
        for i in range(r):
            for j in range(c):
                if board[i][j] == 'E':
                    board[i][j] = 'O'
                elif board[i][j] == 'O':
                    board[i][j] = 'X'
```
