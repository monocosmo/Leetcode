# 465. Optimal Account Balancing
### Hard

A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

**Note:**
1. A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x ≠ y and z > 0.
2. Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
[[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]

Output:
1

Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
```

**思路：**

这个方法其实是暴力法。Part 1的思路应该可以快速理清，对于明显是图的题，将edge list转化为neighbors adjacency list是常规做法。有区别的是这道题是weighted edge，所以转化的时候可以将edge weight记录到两个端点上。

后面的DFS过程需要注意两点：每一次DFS都需要剪枝（去掉debt已经为0）的点。然后每一路DFS return后需要将之前改过的值还原。在数岛系列问题里也有相似的操作。

**Code:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution(object):
    def minTransfers(self, transactions):
        """
        :type transactions: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        debt = defaultdict(int)
        for t in transactions:
            debt[t[0]] -= t[2]
            debt[t[1]] += t[2]
        # debt[1] means how much person 1 owe others
        # if negative, it means how much others owe person 1
        
        # only consider non zero debt persons
        accounts = [x for x in debt.values() if x != 0]
        
        # use dfs to loop through the accounts and clean debts one by one
        return self.dfs(accounts, 0)
    
    def dfs(self, accounts, s):
        res = float('inf')
        # try every one after start, whose debt is oposite that could balance the debt of start
        # and so on... keep the min res
        while s < len(accounts) and accounts[s] == 0:
            # skip the zeros again since zeros can be generated during the dfs
            s +=1
        if s == len(accounts):
            return 0
        # try every one after start, who could balance start debt
        for i in range(s+1, len(accounts), 1):
            if accounts[s]*accounts[i] < 0:
                # transfer s debt to i so s will be zero (even though we did not really do it)
                accounts[i] +=accounts[s]
                res = min(res, self.dfs(accounts, s+1) + 1)
                # restore debt[i] for other loops
                accounts[i] -=accounts[s]
        return res
```
