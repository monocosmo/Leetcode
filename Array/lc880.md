# 880. Decoded String at Index
### Medium

You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.
Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation: The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".
```

**思路：**

先算出decode以后的总长度，然后倒过来decode：
1. 遇到数字，总长度缩短相应的倍数。
2. k缩小为 k % total_len （这个的解释看下图）。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def decodeAtIndex(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # brute force method: using too much space
        # res = []
        # for c in s:
        #     if c not in '0123456789':
        #         res.append(c)
        #     else:
        #         res = res + res*(int(c))
        # return res[k]

        # new method:
        # first decode the string until its length exceeds k and record the index on s
        # (so the rest part of s is useless)
        # Then reverse loop from the index until head of s
        # when meets digit, devide length and module k (This is the Key Step)
        # Why module k? because this step is shreking a string (which has repeats part) to one part
        # so the letter on k-th position will be the same as the letter on k%x position
        # when meets a letter, check if k == 0 or k == length
        # length reduce 1

        # # index on s
        # i = 0
        # # total length of decoding
        # length = 0

        # # decoding until total length greater than or equal to k
        # while length < k:
        #     if s[i] in '0123456789':
        #         length *= int(s[i])
        #     else:
        #         length += 1
        #     i += 1
        
        # # travesal backward until k==0 or k==length
        # for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
        #     if s[j] in '0123456789':
        #         length //= int(s[j])
        #         k %= length
        #     else:
        #         if k == 0 or k == length:
        #             return s[j]
        #         length -= 1
        
        # return ''

        total_length = 0
        for c in s:
            if c in '0123456789':
                total_length *= int(c)
            else:
                total_length += 1
        
        # travesal backward, decoding the string and shrink k until k==0 or k==length
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] in '0123456789':
                total_length //= int(s[i])
                k %= total_length
            else:
                if k == 0 or k == total_length:
                    return s[i]
                total_length -= 1
        
        return ''
