# 337. House Robber III
### Medium

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example:**

```
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**思路：**

对于每一个根节点，只有偷或者不偷两种情况。偷根节点的话，左右子节点就不能偷。不偷根节点，左右子节点可以偷，具体偷不偷取决于子节点的子节点的情况。这个关系是可以递归到整颗树的。

**Code:**
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        # robOrNot returns a tuple: (val of rob root, val of not rob root)
        def robOrNot(root):
            if not root:
                return 0,0
            
            left = robOrNot(root.left)
            right = robOrNot(root.right)
            
            # if rob root, then must not rob root.left and root.right
            rob = root.val + left[1] + right[1]
            
            # if not rob root, then may rob root.left and root.right but depends
            notRob = max(left) + max(right)
            
            return rob, notRob
        
        return max(robOrNot(root)) 
```
