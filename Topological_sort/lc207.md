# 207. Course Schedule
### Medium

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example:**
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**思路：**

有向图拓扑排序的标准题。删掉每个入度为0的点(拓扑排序的头)，并加入到拓扑序列中。然后用BFS更新该点的每个下属点的入度，如果产生了新的入度为0的点，继续加入BFS的Q，直到没有入度为0的点(如果还有剩下的点，说明该有向图有环，不是DAG，无法拓扑排序)。如果没有剩下的点了，那么拓扑序列的长度应该是原始DAG的点数和。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        :type numCourses: int
        :type prerequisites: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        subCourses = {x:[] for x in range(numCourses)}
        degrees = [0 for _ in range(numCourses)]
        
        for [i,j] in prerequisites:
            subCourses[j].append(i)
            degrees[i] +=1
        
        Q = []
        topoOrder = []
        for i in range(len(degrees)):
            if degrees[i] == 0:
                Q.append(i)
        
        while Q:
            course = Q.pop(0)
            topoOrder.append(course)
            for subCourse in subCourses[course]:
                degrees[subCourse] -=1
                if degrees[subCourse] == 0:
                    Q.append(subCourse)
        
        return len(topoOrder) == numCourses
```
