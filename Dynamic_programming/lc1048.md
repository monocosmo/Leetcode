# 1048. Longest String Chain
### Medium

Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say word1 is a predecessor of word2 if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2.  For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac".

A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with k >= 1, where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of word_3, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

**Example:**

```
Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: one of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
```

**思路：**
特别好的一道DP结合hashmap的题。

首先，肯定要sort array，这样dp now才能和dp pre建立联系。
第二，这道题不同于以前的数组记录dp的题是因为dp[i]和dp[i-1]并没有直接联系，没办法写转移方程。但是dp[now]和dp[pre]是有关的。怎么找dp[pre]呢？按照题目里的规则依次查找每一种dp[pre]的可能性就行了。

因此，就需要用hashmap记录dp，然后循环sorted array就行了。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestStrChain(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """
        words = sorted(words, key=lambda x:len(x))
        dp = {word: 1 for word in words}
        longest = 1
        
        for word in words:
            for i in range(len(word)):
                # try to delete each letter in word to form prev word
                prev = word[:i] + word[i+1:]
                if prev in dp:
                    dp[word] = max(dp[word], dp[prev]+1)
            longest = max(longest, dp[word])
        
        return longest
```
