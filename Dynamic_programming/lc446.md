# 446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence
### Hard

Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences.
For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence.
A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
```

**思路：**
dp 本质上是缓存，具体存什么呢？比较简单直接的，array相关的dp题都是存以当前坐标结尾（i）的子序列的特征（长度，排列组合数）。这题问的是等差数量。如果给定数列的结尾和公差，数列就定了。如果只给定结尾，那就是要存一个不同公差下排列组合数的字典：
```python
# dp[i] = {diff_1: count, diff_2: count, ...}
# dict of count on each type of common diff, ending with nums[i]
```
而公差则来源于 nums[i] - nums[j] (for j in range i)。据此可知需要两层for loop进行迭代。
接下来是这题最难的地方：确定迭代公式。
每次迭代需要新增的排列组合数有两种：
1. for each pre qualified subseq ending with nums[i], add nums[j] into it, which makes dp[i][diff] + 1
2. besides, dp[j][diff] contains subseq with at least two elements, add each of them to dp[i][diff]
第二种排列组合数目对应的子序列长度肯定是大于等于3的。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        total = 0
        # dp[i] = {diff_1: count, diff_2: count, ...}
        # dict of count on each type of common diff, ending with nums[i]
        dp = [{} for _ in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                diff = nums[i] - nums[j]
                # for each pre qualified subseq ending with nums[i], add nums[j] into it, which makes dp[i][diff] + 1
                dp[i][diff] = dp[i].get(diff, 0) + 1
                # besides, dp[j][diff] contains subseq with at least two elements
                # add each of them to dp[i][diff]
                # these dp[j][diff] will form subseq len >= 3
                if diff in dp[j]:
                    dp[i][diff] += dp[j][diff]
                    total += dp[j][diff]
                
        return total
```
