# 97. Interleaving String
### Medium

Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m 
substrings respectively, such that:

```
s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
```

The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.

**Example:**

```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.
```

**思路：**

两个字符串转换成一个字符串，可以用2D DP来做。 DP的固定套路: 
1. DP表达式: dp[i][j] 表示 s1[:i] 和 s2[:j] 可以转化成 s3[:i+j]
2. DP的迭代公式: dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]) or (dp[i][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])
3. DP的起始项: dp[0][0] = True
4. 先填充边界: dp[i][0], dp[0][j]

注意事项还是一样: dp会比s1, s2多一位, s1[:i]实际上是s1[0, 1, 2, ... i-1]

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:
        len_s1 = len(s1)
        len_s2 = len(s2)
        len_s3 = len(s3)

        if len_s3 != len_s1 + len_s2:
            return False
        
        # 2D dp
        # dp[i][j] means s1[:i] and s2[:j] can be convert to s3[:i+j]
        # init dp[0][0] means '' and '' can be convert to '' (so dp has one more dimension then s1, s2)
        dp = [[False] * (len_s2 + 1) for _ in range(len_s1 + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = True

        # dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]) or (dp[i][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])
        # fill in edges of dp first
        for i in range(1, len_s1 + 1):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] and s1[i-1] == s3[i-1]
        for j in range(1, len_s2 + 1):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[j-1]
        
        # fill in the rest of dp
        for i in range(1, len_s1 + 1):
            for j in range(1, len_s2 + 1):
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]) or (dp[i][j-1] and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])
        
        return dp[len_s1][len_s2]
```
