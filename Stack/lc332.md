# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary
### Medium

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

**Note:**

1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
4. One must use all the tickets once and only once.

**Example:**

```
Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.
```

**思路：**

这题的难点还是读懂题。一条路走到头再换另一条路。答案的实现方式是用stack记录dfs的path，走到头了以后就把整个path放到res里。记录des的graph里同样用了stack，这样的好处是不用考虑dfs剪枝的问题了，遍历过的点就丢掉了。

**Code:**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findItinerary(self, tickets):
        """
        :type tickets: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for u, v in tickets:
            graph[u].append(v)
        
        for u in graph.keys():
            graph[u].sort(reverse=True)
        
        stack = ["JFK"]
        res = []
        
        while stack:
            u = stack[-1]
            if len(graph[u]) > 0:
                # u still has some des
                stack.append(graph[u].pop())
            else:
                res.append(stack.pop())
        
        return res[::-1]
```
