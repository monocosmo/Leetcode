# 752. Open the Lock
### Medium

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
Output: 6
Explanation:
A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
```

**思路：**

这道题的难点还是在如何快速的把题目理解成一个树的问题。每次改变一个数字（加或者减），所以每个根节点有八个子节点。最快到达目标密码也就是问根节点到目标节点有多少层。deadends可以理解为一组根节点被剪枝了，所以可以合并到visited记录里。

额外写出两个改变某个数位的helper function有助于厘清BFS内部的逻辑。

**Code:**
```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        # deadends can be combined with visited dict since the branches rooted frm deadends will never be visited
        visited = set(deadends)
        
        # helper functions to generate new code by moving up or moving down on position i
        def up(input_code, i):
            code = list(input_code)
            if code[i] == "9":
                code[i] = "0"
            else:
                code[i] = str(int(code[i]) + 1)
            return ''.join(code)
        
        def down(input_code, i):
            code = list(input_code)
            if code[i] == "0":
                code[i] = "9"
            else:
                code[i] = str(int(code[i]) - 1)
            return ''.join(code)
        
        # use BFS to iterate all possible combinations layer by layer
        count = 0
        q = deque(["0000"])
        while q:
            for i in range(len(q)):
                root = q.popleft()
                # check if reached target
                if root == target:
                    return count
                # check if visited
                if root not in visited:
                    visited.add(root)
                    # add children nodes to q
                    for i in range(4):
                        q.append(up(root, i))
                        q.append(down(root, i))
            # end of this layer, move++
            count +=1
        # finished iteration of the whole tree
        return -1
```
