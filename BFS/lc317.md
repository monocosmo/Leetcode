# 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings
### Hard

You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 7 

Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
```

**思路：**

在matrix里求点到点的距离用BFS基本上是定律了。这道题的难点是反过来想，从每个building出发访问每个0点。好处是很多0点是到不了所有的building的，因此可以利用全局变量记录之前已经遍历过几个building了，然后每个0点也记录之前被几个building访问过，如果BFS过程中碰到的0点的reachable值和全局当前已经遍历过的building数不想等，说明：这个0点要么被visit过了，要么不能被之前的某些building访问，实际上相当于一个obstacle。这个同时记录visited和valid的做法相当精髓！

在BFS算距离的时候记录step或者说lvl的方法可以背一下，经常会这么写：

```
            q = collections.deque([(i, j, 0)]) # 0: this is the start point
            while q:
                x, y, step = q.popleft()
                ...
                        dis[nx][ny] +=(step+1)
                        reach[nx][ny] +=1
                        q.append((nx, ny, step+1))

```

**Code:**
```python

    def shortestDistance(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return -1
        
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        # total distance of this block to all buildings
        dis = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        # total reachable buildings from this block
        reach = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        
        def bfs(i, j, buildings): # buildings: how many buildings screened
            q = collections.deque([(i, j, 0)]) # 0: this is the start point
            while q:
                x, y, step = q.popleft()
                for dx, dy in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                    nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
                    if nx>=0 and nx<m and ny>=0 and ny<n and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and reach[nx][ny] == buildings:
                        # if reach[i][j] != buildings means this block cannot be visited by some previous buildings
                        dis[nx][ny] +=(step+1)
                        reach[nx][ny] +=1
                        q.append((nx, ny, step+1))
        
        buildings = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1: # start from building to each 0
                    bfs(i, j, buildings)
                    buildings +=1
        
        res = float('inf')
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                # pick the best 0 which can reach to every building
                if grid[i][j] == 0 and reach[i][j] == buildings:
                    res = min(res, dis[i][j])
        
        if res < float('inf'):
            return res
        else:
            return -1
