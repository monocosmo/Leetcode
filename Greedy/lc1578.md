# 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful
### Medium

Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i] is the color of the ith balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

**Example:**

```
Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
```

**思路：**

这道题有一行比较tricky的代码：
1. 两两比较，如果 i 和 i - 1 颜色相同，去掉耗时较少的那个。这个逻辑很直接，不必解释。
2. 如果连续出现颜色相同的（且之前已经去掉过这种颜色的灯了），是没办法再去掉一次的。举个例子：
```python
# e.g. if 'abbbc' and the second 'b' was chosen when comparing with the first 'b',
# then meets the third 'b', since the second 'b' cannot be 'remove' for another time,
# we update its cost same as the first 'b'.
if neededTime[i] < neededTime[i-1]:
    neededTime[i] = neededTime[i-1]
```              

**Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, colors: str, neededTime: List[int]) -> int:
        time = 0
        for i in range(1, len(colors)):
            if colors[i] == colors[i-1]:
                time += min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i-1])
                if neededTime[i] < neededTime[i-1]:
                    # e.g. if 'abbbc' and the second 'b' was chosen when comparing with the first 'b',
                    # then meets the third 'b', since the second 'b' cannot be 'remove' for another time,
                    # we update its cost same as the first 'b'.
                    neededTime[i] = neededTime[i-1]
        return time
```
